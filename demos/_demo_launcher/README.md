# Demo Launcher

To start a Crossbar.io node with all the demos (exactly as on [https://demo.crossbar.io](https://demo.crossbar.io)), open a terminal, go to this folder and

```console
crossbar start
```

Now open [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080) in your browser. You should see an overview page of the Crossbar.io demos, launchable from there.

> Note: This also runs the backends of any demos which require them.
